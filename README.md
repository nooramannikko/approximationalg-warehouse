# Warehouse Router

This is a Warehouse Router application created for the course Approximation Algorithms.

The application implements a Nearest Addition algorithm and a brute-force algorithm for finding the best route in a warehouse layout for a given set of targets.

The application is built with C# and .NET Core, and these have to be installed before the application can be run. The application is a console application and can be run from the command line with command "dotnet run". The command "dotnet build" might be needed first. Once the application is running, use command "help" to see available options.
